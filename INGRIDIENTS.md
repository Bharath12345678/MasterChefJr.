Paneer: Indian Cottage cheese. I always prefer to use homemade paneer for most of my paneer recipes. But for this pakora, you can use store-bought paneer as well.
Besan: also known as gram flour or chickpeas flour. 
Spices and Seasonings: Red chilli powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, chaat masala powder, Salt, grated ginger, ajwain (carom seeds), green chilli, coriander/cilantro.
Rice bran oil: You can use any vegetable oil with a high smoke point. In my experience rice bran oil is the best for deep frying.
